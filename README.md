# Customer Rewards app 🎁

This app displays customer rewards for fictional purchases in the past 90 days. 

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.

A JSON file is used to pull the data and 'fake' api request. The data is then used to populate the interface on a per customer basis removing any transactions over 30 days.
